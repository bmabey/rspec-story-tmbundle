Textmate Bundle for RSpec plain text stories

Features:
  * Color highlighting for plain text stories
    * Themes that have been modified to take advantage of this can be found in color_themes/
  * Simple snippets for plain text stories and scenarios
  * Predefined completions (escape key) for common story keywords
  * Spellchecking turned on by default for the plaintext stories
  * Run the current plain text story and display in HTML (see caveats)
  * Switch between plain text story and corresponding step matcher file (see caveats)

Caveats about running stories:
  * Requires edge rspec (not 1.1.3)
  * Currently, the running of stories and file switching relies on the following directory structure:
     Basic stories (no sub-directories):
     
       /project_root/stories
   		   |- basic_story.rb
   		   |- stories
   		   |   |- basic_story.story (extension does not matter)
   		   |
   		   |- steps
   		       |- basic_story_steps.rb
     
     Using feature sub-directories:
     
       /project_root/stories
  		   |- feature_one
  		   |   |- some_story.rb
  		   |   |- stories
  		   |   |   |- some_story.story (extension does not matter)
  		   |   |
  		   |   |- steps
  		   |       |- some_story_steps.rb
  		   |
  		   |- feature_two
  		   | .....
  	
  	These directory structures can be used together (basic stories can reside in the root stories directory,
  	and feature sets can be put in sub directories).
		

TODO:
  * Improve HTML output to show failing information.
  * POSSIBLE - Make SHIFT-CTRL-DOWN use goto_specific_step if on a step (no need for SHIFT-CTRIL-OPTION-DOWN)
  * If in story file, and step file doesn't exist, and going to specific step - make snippets work correctly
      - currently inserts new step and tag name of step file - steps_for(:Given "blah blah" ...)
  * When in step file - if doing SHIFT-CTRL-OPTION-DOWN - go to first step that mat
  * Make running a story more robust to work with any configuration.
  * Run All Stories command.
  * Run Selected Stories command.
  * Switch Command
		* Easily switch between a plain text story and it's runner ruby file.
  * Step Navigation
    * Be able to quickly navigate to the step files that are being used for the current story.
    * Automatically go to the selected step or create it if it does not exist.
